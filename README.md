This project is an extention exercise to use Java and MySQL to make a ui for a cafe in which they can add meals to an orders table and also read one/all as well as being able to delete either one meal or all

# How to use

Run via Eclipse to be presented with a list of options. Simply typing the letter of the opton you want to use will execute that specific command

Some options will then require you to type in an ID number for it to be able to access a specific item from the table
